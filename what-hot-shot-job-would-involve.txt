### what the job of producing the overall driver ranking would involve:

### stripping out the team names from forix
### cleaning up team names to make them consistent between years
### fetching data from other series on the junior ladder
### filling in the gaps in terms of number of races for formulae that we don't have data for e.g. japanese f4

## none of that actually seems to be too bad TBH

### what about the model
## could make a start with simulated data?
## inputs would be: driver latent ability
## team latent ability
## a curve representing benefit of driving that car
## a curve representing benefit of driving any car
## then you simulate a lap time
## and throw some outliers in
## then simulate the race result messily from that plus the starting position
## so our model would ideally get better as we include the lap times from qualifying plus the finishing positions
## but we want the model to give more credit if you do well against a strong field eg f2 than a weak field eg f4
## that all sounds very hard
